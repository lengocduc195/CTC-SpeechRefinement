# Technical Debt and Known Limitations

This document outlines the current technical debt and known limitations of the CTC Speech Transcription system. It serves as a guide for future development and improvement.

## Current Technical Debt

### 1. Model Loading and Initialization

- **Issue**: The acoustic model is loaded for each run, which is inefficient for batch processing.
- **Impact**: Slow startup time, especially for large models.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement a model caching mechanism or a service-based architecture where the model stays loaded.

### 2. Error Handling

- **Issue**: Some error handling is basic and could be more robust.
- **Impact**: The system might fail in unexpected ways when encountering edge cases.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 3. Testing Coverage

- **Issue**: Limited automated test coverage.
- **Impact**: Increased risk of regressions when making changes.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### 4. Documentation

- **Issue**: Some internal functions lack detailed documentation.
- **Impact**: Makes it harder for new developers to understand and modify the code.
- **Potential Solution**: Add more detailed docstrings and comments.

## Known Limitations

### 1. Language Support

- **Limitation**: The system is primarily designed for English speech.
- **Impact**: May not perform well on other languages.
- **Potential Solution**: Add support for multilingual models and language-specific decoders.

### 2. Noise Robustness

- **Limitation**: Performance degrades in noisy environments.
- **Impact**: Less accurate transcriptions for audio with background noise.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement more advanced noise reduction techniques or use models fine-tuned for noisy environments.

### 3. Speaker Diarization

- **Limitation**: The system does not distinguish between different speakers.
- **Impact**: Cannot attribute speech to specific speakers in multi-speaker audio.
- **Potential Solution**: Integrate speaker diarization capabilities.

### 4. Real-time Processing

- **Limitation**: The system is designed for batch processing, not real-time transcription.
- **Impact**: Not suitable for live transcription applications without modification.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement streaming capabilities and optimize for low latency.

### 5. Resource Requirements

- **Limitation**: Large models require significant computational resources.
- **Impact**: May not run efficiently on resource-constrained devices.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement model quantization and optimization techniques.

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Usage

- **Issue**: Large audio files or batch processing can consume significant memory.
- **Impact**: May cause out-of-memory errors on systems with limited RAM.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement streaming processing and better memory management.

### 2. GPU Utilization

- **Issue**: GPU utilization could be optimized further.
- **Impact**: Suboptimal processing speed on GPU-enabled systems.
- **Potential Solution**: Optimize batch sizes and model loading for better GPU utilization.

### 3. Disk I/O

- **Issue**: Frequent disk I/O for large datasets.
- **Impact**: Can become a bottleneck in processing pipelines.
- **Potential Solution**: Implement better buffering and asynchronous I/O.

## Future Improvements

### 1. Language Model Integration

- **Improvement**: Better integration with external language models.
- **Benefit**: Improved transcription accuracy, especially for domain-specific vocabulary.

### 2. Fine-tuning Capabilities

- **Improvement**: Add capabilities to fine-tune models on domain-specific data.
- **Benefit**: Better performance for specific use cases.

### 3. Adaptive Preprocessing

- **Improvement**: Implement adaptive preprocessing based on audio characteristics.
- **Benefit**: Better handling of diverse audio sources.

### 4. Confidence Scores

- **Improvement**: Add confidence scores for transcribed words.
- **Benefit**: Allow applications to identify potentially incorrect transcriptions.

### 5. Punctuation and Formatting

- **Improvement**: Better handling of punctuation and text formatting.
- **Benefit**: More readable and usable transcriptions.

## Prioritization

Based on impact and effort, we recommend addressing these issues in the following order:

1. Improve error handling and robustness
2. Implement model caching for better performance
3. Add support for confidence scores
4. Improve noise robustness
5. Add multilingual support
6. Implement streaming capabilities for real-time processing
